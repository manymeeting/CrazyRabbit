- Agile Practices Team is Adopting: XP

## XP Agile Core Values: Simplicity, Communication, Feedback, Respect, Courage.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#Values
## 9/23/2017
###  Mutian Wang

- Simplicity. Instead of designing for the whole project at the beginning, we decided to start from a demo of game. By focusing on only the core functions at first, we are able to manipulate MelonJS framwork and Tiled Map Editor in a short time. 
###  Ruifeng Sheng

- In the first week, I would like to pick the "planning" as my core value. Planning can be defined as a process of making a sketch of various courses to achieve goals and objectives. Success and growth of an organization is mainly based on the planning. So we did a detailed planning, and organized our responsibilities to each team member.

###  Zihan Ke
- We picking melonJS as our fundamental development library, Since we have compared several front-end game developer tools, the melonJS has the best performance as well as fit out demanding. it is an open source HTML5 game engine that empowers developers and designers to focus on content.The framework provides a collection of composable entities and support for a number of third-party tools. Giving you a powerful combination that can be used wholesale or piecemeal.


###  Weiyu Jin

- I will select communication  as my core agile value throughout the term project exercise. Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face weekly. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

###  Xiaoran Lin

- Courage. As a student who just transferred major, I probably have the fewest computer knowledge among our team. Thanks to god, these beloved teammates accepted me. So at first, I think at least I cannot retreat from challenges when our team is caught by some bottleneck or dilemma. 

## 9/30/2017
###  Mutian Wang
- Simplicity. In order to adopt simplicity in our project, we need to define "Simplicity". Baed upon our discussion and experience, we define "Simplicity" of this project as "every task shoule be testable". That is, we need to ensure that every task provides a clear description so that we can design specific test cases for it.

###  Ruifeng Sheng
- In this week, I would like to pick "communication" as my core value. Communication refers to the exchange of thoughts and ideas with the intention of conveying information. During the "two days" meeting, we are sharing ideas, thoughts or need with clarity so as to reach an acceptable solution. 

###  Zihan Ke
- Nothing comes easy, Nothing comes no pain, This week, we start from a totally green hand to became a melonJS player, We study the library of the MelonJS, also we figure out how to use OO thinking to control different module in our game. We develop the first version of our map, entity, enemy, and player controller. Times goes by, God still love us.

###  Weiyu Jin

- Based on this weeks communication, we decided to use JavaScript as our projects' language. Also, we choose to work create a "new version" of super mario game. Based on what we discussed, we make a plan and set up new dashboard for next week.

###  Xiaoran Lin

- Last week, we faced a challenge that the jump height of character cannot be modified. I tried to find every corner of in thousand lines of codes but I failed to locate the function that enable a character to jump higher. So I took a day off the project. On Friday, I found it in the platform's predefined library and finally solved the jump height problem.

## 10/7/2017
###  Mutian Wang
- Simplicity. We found more issues than we expected during our development process. Some modules are duplicated through out the project, which makes the code hard to maintain. We recectly had a meeting regarding code quality, and we all agreed to a "Once and only once" principle. The principle requires developers to think about the design carefully to reduce the duplicate functions, variables and styles by using patterns or other decoupling techniques.  
###  Ruifeng Sheng

- In this week, I would like to pick "Feedback" as my core value. The communication cycle is incomplete without feedback, and it contributes to the stability and equilibrium of a communication process. After three weeks working, we discussed about the first version of coding and designing parts(like characters and maps). We came to know the positive and negative sides of our work, and made the change immediately. 
 
###  Adam Ke

- God Save the queue. 

###  Weiyu Jin

- Based on this weeks communication, we all worked well on our part. We have a communication of our process, goals on next weeks. We also decide to design the first complete map in the game.

###  Xiaoran Lin

- Feedback. It took us three weeks to be able to realize how important it is to get feedback from teammates. One teammate proposed that everyone can make their own branches but once we decide to merge, that branch has to be merged in the "platformer". But I just kept on creating branches and never gave my feedback to others so that no one knew I had some modification to the code and those codes had to be merged in the platformer, causing slow down in the flow.

## 10/21/2017
###  Mutian Wang
- Simplicity. As our team members become more and more skillful, I found that sometimes we are likely to think too much at the beginning. For example, we may leave some empty functions with TODO comments. It sounds fine in most cases, however, as the code evolves we always found that those TODO functions and classes become useless or even blocks our process. This fact tells us to think simple at first, and don't dive into the advanced design until when we actually need it. 

###  Ruifeng Sheng

- In this week, I would like to pick "courage" as my core value. Courage is the ability to face a fear, pain, or a difficult obstacle. Like we met a big challenge this week, some members were during their midterm week, we chose the "zoom-meeting" instead of face-to-face meeting. having courage gives us the ability to working harder. 

###  Zihan Ke
- This is the worst week of my life! I add new player to the game. Unfortunately, i the new player looks so bad, It's time to figure out how to choose a good pixel to fixed in the whole game as well as keep the integrate and atom of the Game. We will carry on.

###  Weiyu Jin

- Based on this weeks communication, we celebrate our achievement we did on last weeks. We also communicate the challenges we are facing, some members are getting busy. We courage each other and set a good goal of next week.

###  Xiaoran Lin

- Simplicity. This week I learnt that even though the project was big, every issue could be very simple and clear.
A vague description of what we should do and what a feature was will do nothing but elongate our communication and slow down the process. Simplicity here means clear goal and D.O.D.

## 10/28/2017
###  Mutian Wang
- Courage. Whenever we face overwhelming problems, we are supposed to seek for solutions instead of trying to put it aside, because problems never disappear unless we actually solve it by ourselves.

###  Ruifeng Sheng

- As the first week of scrum, we discussed what we did in last four weeks, and re-planned what we will do in next four weeks in details. 

###  Zihan Ke
- And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. This week we added new Background, new BGM, new Game voice. How cool it is ? PFC!
###  Weiyu Jin

- Based on this weeks communication, we discussed about what will be the final version of our project. Also, we set up a new timeline based on the due date and each members' schedule. Our two goals for the next week 1. Added elements for main character 2.Designed the stage2 map.

###  Xiaoran Lin

- It is still the courage that leads me this week. Even though I had poor arts background, I designed a whole scroll map myself. It did not work out in the game, but I was confident I will fix it next week.

## 11/04/2017
###  Mutian Wang
- Courage. Sometimes it's hard to understand what is the biggest problem in the team because the most important information can be somehow hidden by its owner. In order to discover the difficulties we have and find solutions, each team member is encouraged to report issues as soon as possible, so that we can respond immediately and work together to solve the problem. 

###  Ruifeng Sheng
- Communication. During this week, we were try merging our branches to the master branch. But not as the expected, it has a lot of conflicts of each member's commits. Due to this situation, we had to have more meetings this week, to discuss each branch coming from and working for, also to format the way of the branch named. 

###  Zihan Ke
- Added new Hud features, This help with the measure the number of collection coins. It's a key feature which we will be use this number to decide the life circle of main character. Next week we will add more maps as well as add another key feature, add CheckPoint. This will deal with swithing between diffrernt Maps.

###  Weiyu Jin
- Based on this weeks communication, we discuss about the last week's process. Also, we also discuss about the git operation avoid messing up the branch. 

###  Xiaoran Lin

- Communication. Last week my map design did not work, but my teammates pointed out my mistake and taught me how to fix that mistake. Then I did it. Mutian Wang was a nice teacher, he always knew what my problem was and what I was worried about, and since I wanted to fix my mistake, the communication went on so well.

## 11/11/2017
###  Mutian Wang
 - Courage: This week we encountered some bugs that lay deep inside the core of melon.js. To solve the issue, one of my team member and I digged into the source code and figured out a solution that we can reuse for all other similiar issues. Courage is the most important thing that drove us to achieve the goal.

###  Ruifeng Sheng
- Coordinate: Due to different segments tend to work in isolation from one another and the achievement of overall objective suffers. For this week, designed a new enemy, and re-draw the main characters by the right size is my work. Since the first version can not be with our coding part. We realized the importance of coordination, at first we all focus on our own part and cause this satuiation. we will make all parts together next week. 

###  Zihan Ke

- Added new Hud features, This help with the measure the number of collection coins. It's a key feature which we will be use this number to decide the life circle of main character. Next week we will add more maps as well as add another key feature, add CheckPoint. This will deal with swithing between diffrernt Maps.


###  Weiyu Jin
- During this week, my main work is to fix the map's bug, add element and delete element. Xiaoran Lin worked with me and we build a good communication. Also, Mutian Wang is a very good teacher, he taught me a lot which save me a lot of times. 

###  Xiaoran Lin

- Communication. Last week we had video meetings on zoom. I've got some questions about the how our main player can die, can kill enemy and can have two lives. And Mutian Wang explained everything so perfect and was patient to questions from every teammate, I liked his style, and he created great team culture.

## 11/18/2017
###  Mutian Wang


###  Ruifeng Sheng
- focus.  Focus on a few things at a time. Having a clear role and clear goals within that role. Your job then is to do just that use your role to contribute to achieving the goal! At first part of this week, I focus on drawing all the elements.The rest of this week, I was trying to fix some bugs. Part of the magic of scrum is that it’s built around the very concept of focus.


###  Zihan Ke



###  Weiyu Jin

###  Xiaoran Lin
- Communication. Last week I pushed the most code I have ever done to the project. Because I learnt a lot from my teammates through great communication. In this way, I can design and extend the code. That's great experience!

You must have `grunt-cli` installed globally:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

In the cloned directory, run the game:

    grunt serve

And you will have the boilerplate example running on http://localhost:8000

### Building Release Versions

To build:

    grunt

This will create a `build` directory containing the files that can be uploaded to a server, or packaged into a mobile app.

Building a standalone desktop release:

    grunt dist

Running the desktop release on Windows:

    .\bin\electron.exe

Running the desktop release on macOS:

    open ./bin/Electron.app

Running the desktop release on Linux:
